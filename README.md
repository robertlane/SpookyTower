**Mod the Game: Python Arcade Remix **
A spooky vertical jumper remix of "IcyTower" by Team _Rob, Elias, and Scarlet_

---

**Project Overview**
This project is a collaborative remix of a Python Arcade platformer game originally titled **IcyTower**, 
created by GitHub user **Bar-Levi**. Our goal was to customize the visual and audio experience, replace the character, 
and add a functional end-game scene—all while practicing modular code editing and teamwork.
